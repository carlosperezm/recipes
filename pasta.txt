Ingredients
-200 g freshly podded or frozen peas
-1 tablespoon flaked almonds
-1 small clove of garlic
-½ a bunch of fresh basil , (15g)
-15 g Parmesan cheese
-1 lemon
-150 g wholewheat spaghetti
-1 rasher of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon
-olive oil
-1 large free-range egg
-100 g fat-free natural yoghurt

Method
Put a pan of boiling salted water on the heat for your pasta, dunk a sieve
containing the peas into the water for just 30 seconds, then put aside, leaving
the pan on the heat. Very lightly toast the almonds in a dry non-stick frying
pan on a medium heat, then blitz until fine in a food processor. With the
processor still running, peel and drop in the garlic, a pinch of sea salt, the
basil leaves, the finely grated Parmesan and the lemon juice. Blitz until it
comes together, then pulse in the peas, to try and keep a bit of texture.

Cook the pasta in the boiling salted water according to the packet
instructions. Meanwhile, very finely slice the bacon and fry slowly in the
frying pan with 1 teaspoon of oil on a medium-low heat until golden and crispy,
then use a slotted spoon to transfer to kitchen paper, so the flavoursome fat
stays in the pan. Scoop in three-quarters of your pea mixture to heat through.

Whisk the egg and yoghurt together well. When the pasta’s done, reserving a
mugful of cooking water, drain the pasta and toss straight into the pea pan,
mixing well, then take the pan off the heat (this is very important, otherwise
the egg will scramble when you add it, and we don’t want that). Pour in the egg
mixture and toss until evenly coated, silky and creamy, loosening with cooking
water if needed. Taste and season to perfection, and serve topped with the
remaining pea mixture and the crispy bacon. It might be skinny, but it’s
beautifully light and delicious. Enjoy!
